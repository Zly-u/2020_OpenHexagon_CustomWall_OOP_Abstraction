# Custom Wall extension module for [Open Hexagon](https://github.com/SuperV1234/SSVOpenHexagon)

Extends the functionality of custom walls in [Open Hexagon](https://github.com/SuperV1234/SSVOpenHexagon) by [SuperV1234](https://twitter.com/supahvee1234).

Made for my own practice in general.

Example of what's possible to make with this thing in the game: [Dino Game Clone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnB_mIzd1xo)

## What this lib used to allow you to do:
  - To use it as some sort of crappy 2D engine because I managed to abuse the walls in the game to act as polygons for drawing, transforming and etc.
  - Camera System for the entire thing.
  - SOme other stuff, I don't remember.

## Requirements:
- [Le Game](https://github.com/SuperV1234/SSVOpenHexagon).

- In the code, there is declared documentation that is used by [EmmyLua](https://github.com/EmmyLua) for [Jetbrains](https://www.jetbrains.com) IDEs for providing info and
  autocompletion for the functions and just much better Lua programming in general, any free IntelliJ based IDE will 
  work for you. (But it's not necessary anyway.)
  
- If you want to be able to import sprites into the game then you need to use my sprite editor I've made once for 
  Oshisaure's game [Puzzle Jungle Trouble](https://oshisaure.itch.io/puzzle-juggle-trouble): [PJT Sprite Editor Repo](https://github.com/Zly-u/2019_PJTSE).
  (Will upload soon(tm). It's a bit meh, but works.)

## Usage:
Docs are here: [boop](https://github.com/Zly-u/OpenHexagon_CustomWall_module/wiki). (Doesn't work, there used to be a Wiki bit making this repo private broke it, which is very lame...)

## Credits:
Thanks to [Oshisaure](https://twitter.com/oshisaure) for the help with the code in some places.
